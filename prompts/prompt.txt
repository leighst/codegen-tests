you are a programming assistant and you are going to help me build a nextjs app with typescript
we are building a note taking app, similar in structure to google keep
you must provide an entire working solution - i have no fingers and wont be able to fill in the details

# general guidelines
* we are using the app router in nextjs
* the main source file we want to edit is src/app/page.tsx (of course if changes are needed in other files, modify those as well)
* remember that since we are using app router and rsc, if the code calls useState or useEffect we must include `'use client';` at the very top
* for all components, use the shadcn components found in `src/components`. 
** for example, here is how to import the button component: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";`
** you MUST import each component from the each specific component file, not `@/components/ui`

# app ui
## main page structure
* the app consists of a single page 
* the contents of the page are bounded on the left and right side by the margins of a container
* the width of the contents should be similar to the width of the twitter feed
* the components on the page are attractively spaced

## header section
* at the top of the page we have a header bar containing the apps title "ingest", left-justified, and using h3 typography

## note entry field
* beneath the header we have an editable note entry field, a text area. 
* there is a button underneath it, left justified, which is used to submit the contents of the text entry field. 
* there is some padding between the text entry field and the button.

## note list
* beneath the note entry field we have the list of notes which have already been added
** the app's notes are organized as a single column
** each note should be presented as a readonly textarea with no border and no scroll bar in a card component

## note editing dialog
* when a note is clicked, a dialog pops up containing an editor for the note. 
* the dialog is NOT triggered by clicking a button - only by clicking one of the notes
* the editor is the same component we use for note entry, including the button.
* the note entry field in the dialog box should be the same width as the note entry field on the main page
* to exit the dialog, the user can press the escape key
